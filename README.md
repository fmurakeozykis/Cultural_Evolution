## Project Description

This project investigates how the structure of social networks influences the dynamics of cultural evolution. Specifically, it compares network-based models, in which individuals interact with a fixed set of neighbours, to well-mixed models, where individuals can interact with any other member of the population. The project uses R to simulate these dynamics and analyze outcomes such as trait stability, spread, and variability.

## Requirements

- **R**: This project requires the latest version of R (tested on version 4.4.2).
- **R packages**:
  - `igraph`
  - `ggplot2`

Packages can be installed using:

```R
install.packages(c("igraph", "ggplot2"))
